# Speckit Constitution for Phase 1 Todo App

## Core Principles
1. Follow Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology
2. Maintain clean, readable, and maintainable code
3. Implement in-memory storage with volatile data (no JSON persistence)
4. Support CLI operations for todo management
5. Follow Python best practices and PEP 8 guidelines
6. Data resets on application restart (volatile storage)

## Quality Standards
- Code must be well-documented
- Error handling must be comprehensive
- Input validation is mandatory
- Data volatility must be accepted (no permanent storage)
